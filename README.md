# lab1_searchWord
In this lab, we practice solving two problems using brute-force strategy.

## Goal:

1. Keep practicing Python programming, 
2. Practicing step-wise refinement, checking boundary condition of loops
3. Testing functions with different testcases
4. Please review [this](https://python.pages.doc.ic.ac.uk/cpp/lessons/cpp/04-seq/07-strseq.html) to familarize yourself with **str** in Python. Essenntnially, a string (str) in Python is a list of char. 
   
## Preparation

1. Download the lab1.py. 


## Overall requirements: 
   Please write comments for your functions: write comments before the function header to describe its funcionalities, its parameters and return value. 
   Write comments for keep parts of your function. 

## Detail Requirements:
1.  Implement a function **SearchWord (para, word)** as follows. Note that this is the same problem that we worked during in-class practice:

   
3.  Implement a function **IsSubsequence (para, word)** to test if word is a subsequence of para.
   
5.  Test both of your functions in the **main**, you need to design at least four testcases for each functions.
   
## Submission

Submit your code named **lab1.py** on Blackboard.
